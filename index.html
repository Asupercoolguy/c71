<p class="text-muted">Jantar Mantar is located in the modern city of New Delhi.
   "Jantar Mantar" means "instruments for measuring the harmony of the heavens".
   It consists of 13 architectural astronomy instruments.The Jantar Mantar, Jaipur is a collection of 19 astronomical instruments built by the Rajput king Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of Jaipur, Rajasthan. The monument was completed in 1734.[1][2] It features the world's largest stone sundial, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.[1][3] It is near City Palace and Hawa Mahal.[4] The instruments allow the observation of astronomical positions with the naked eye.[1] The observatory is an example of the Ptolemaic positional astronomy which was shared by many civilizations.[1][2]

   The monument features instruments operating in each of the three main classical celestial coordinate systems: the horizon-zenith local system, the equatorial system, and the ecliptic system.[2] The Kanmala Yantraprakara is one that works in two systems and allows transformation of the coordinates directly from one system to the other.[5] It has the biggest sundial in the world.
   
   The monument was damaged in the 19th century. Early restoration work was undertaken under the supervision of Major Arthur Garrett, a keen amateur astronomer, during his appointment as Assistant State Engineer for the Jaipur District.</p>

  <h5 class="text-sucsess text-capitalize">I visited theis place 3 months ago and it was a wonder.</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">rithvi Theatre was finally inaugurated on 5 November 1978 in Mumbai. The first play that took place at the theatre was Udhwastha Dharmashala. Written by G P Deshpande, the play was staged by Naseeruddin Shah, Om Puri and Benjamin Gilani. The Indian People’s Theatre Association (IPTA) then staged a play called Bakri, which was a political satire directed by actor-director, M. S. Sathyu. By 1983, the Prithvi Cafe attached to the Theatre became a common gathering place for artists and art lovers.

    Post Jennifer Kapoor’s death, her eldest son, Kunal Kapoor took over the responsibility of running the theatre. Feroz Abbas Khan helped him with the functioning of the place. Kunal Kapoor’s sister, Sanjna Kapoor, started helping Kunal as well. In the 1990s, she introduced a host of new activities and workshops as well. The theatre hosts over 540 shows in a year, Tuesday through Sunday. The Prithvi Cafe also hosts millions of people from all across Mumbai throughout the year.</p>

<p>Long a bit boring but atlest it had a few good bits. Not the biggest fan. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, or you will miss 40% of the storyline. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy and it  runs for 3 hours.</p>
